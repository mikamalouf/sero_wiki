An R Shiny app was created by the Drakeley group at the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine to standardise the quality control steps of analysing raw multiplex datasets from a Luminex machine.
- If the assay passes the quality control checks, then the data can be cleaned and downloaded for downstream analysis
- no coding is needed
Background and instructions can be found here XXXXX

The app can be accessed [here](https://mikamalouf.shinyapps.io/Luminex_Data_Analysis/). XXX NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT YET
