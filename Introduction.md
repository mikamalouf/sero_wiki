# Introduction
Offers background as to what sero-surveillence is, what it does, and steps to interpret multi-pathogen, multiplex datasets

## Serology
Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are produced by the immune system in response to exposure to antigens in the form of infections or vaccinations. 
- there are 5 different types of immunoglobulins in humans
- IgM produces first but quickly wanes after the infection is cleared
- IgG is the longest lasting isotype

types of antibody presence meaning (Metcalf paper)

Serology, what it is, and what it can tell us

### Sero-epidemiology
- traditional surveillance methods miss asymptomatic and mild cases
- sero epi
- reference Isabel's book chapter (Examples of applications of serology as an epidemiological tool)(https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-76448-6_6)

## Seroanalytics
Unravelling the historic exposure of a pathogen through serology is a multi-step process that is broadly visualized through this pipeline created by the Seroanalytics Hub from Johns Hopkins. 
- sample collection
- lab (preprocess)
- defining seropositivity
