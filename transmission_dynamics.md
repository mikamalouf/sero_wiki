Scripts to establish transmission dynamics from multiplex dataset from 2 settings:
1. High transmission setting estimating malarial seroprevalence in Uganda
2. Low transmission setting estimating malarial seroprevalence in a malaria-eliminated country in Southeast Asia

Both transmission scripts reads in functions from a separate script to create the finite mixture model, calculate the age-stratified seroprevalence curve, amongst other things. For more information on the functions, please visit the [GitHub.](https://github.com/mikamalouf/seroimmunology-epi_practical/tree/main/functions)
